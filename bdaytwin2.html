        <h1>Happy Birthday, My Soulmate!</h1>
        <p>Creating videos on birthday are overrated. I wanted to do something unique and something special on ur special day.</p>
        <p>At first I thought of sending u a letter which I have already done before but apparently I wanted the letter to reach to you on the day, no sooner or later, (ur bday gift didüòëüòí) which basically depends on luck.</p>
        <p>This is my very first time where I am not able to celebrate ur bday with you. But ofc the distance can't make this day as a barrier to me coz ur bday means my birthday. I was actually planning to come to Mumbai and give u a surprise but unforunately I cldn't do it. But one thing for sure tht we'll do an after party,"GO CLUBBING" yayyyayy.
I really really miss u alot especially on your day. I am just an emotional freak getting emotional while writing this. But to MY GIRL, "We be anywhere in this world, the distance can not make us apart. All of ur highs and lows, happiness and sadness here we go again with another year of roller coasters together screaming and yelling but having fun altogether. Eagerly waiting to meet u n hug u tight. I have got a plenty of things to say to u F2F (basically the long long never ending conversations of us). One call n I'll be there to you, for you (I dont fucking care how busy i am but for u I'll always be present. NO HESISTATION ON CALLING ME WHEN U NEED ME TO SHARE SADNESS OR HAPPINESS I AM ALWAYS THERE TO LISTEN TO YOU WHILE BEING PRESENT WITH YOU NEAR YOU)</p>
